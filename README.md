## Motivations
1. SVG is very useful format by using vector graphics. We can use SVG with free width and height. But I couldn't find how use SVG with my own Win32/C# project.
2. I tried SVG to Bitmap object, Single Instance Application and Save/Read Configure to each users folder.

## How To Use
1. Download from latest version. https://github.com/aymspecial/MiniSvgViewer/releases
2. Copy (or move) MiniSvgViewer.exe to anywhere you like.
3. Double Click!!
